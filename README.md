# Hello, folks! <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" height ="30px" width="30px">
<h3>I'm Claudia Diaz
<br>a Full Stack Software Engineer & Business Consultant<br></h3>

Being resourceful when resources are scarce has been my life-long specialty. I am a first-generation professional who went from South Central LA to Berkeley-Haas to the Tech start-up scene.

I enjoy building and creating new and interesting, highly-scalable applications.** Languages that I am familiar with include: C#, JavaScript, and T-SQL.**

I have worked with jQuery and React.js ES6 for front-end JavaScript frameworks, ASP.NET Core 6.0 in C# for server development. I am familiar with MS SQL Server (SSMS )for backend database design and structuring. I have worked in an agile / SCRUM environment with daily stand-up, and code review.

Every challenge I come across is an opportunity for growth, and programming happens to be an excellent source.

You can find me on [![LinkedIn][2.2]][2].
